# sad_chess

Just got out of my first coding interview.
It was awful, the interviewer was pretty nice tbh but I had no I idea of what I was doing.
So many dumb and rookie mistkes (I am a newbie but still sucks)
I overcomplicated almost all the questions, just to see it after some time how easy and doable it was
Just god a lil mad with my self after the interview, sat down and coded chess from scratch
i hope I am more prepered and to commit less dummy mistakes
